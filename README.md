# UVAtlas - isochart texture atlasing

http://go.microsoft.com/fwlink/?LinkID=512686

Copyright (c) Microsoft Corporation.

**February 21, 2024**

This package contains UVAtlas, a shared source library for creating and packing an isochart texture atlas.

This code is designed to build with Visual Studio 2019 (16.11), Visual Studio 2022, clang for Windows v12 or later, or MinGW 12.2. Use of the Windows 10 May 2020 Update SDK ([19041](https://walbourn.github.io/windows-10-may-2020-update-sdk/)) or later is required for Visual Studio. It can also be built for Windows Subsystem for Linux using GCC 11 or later.

These components are designed to work without requiring any content from the legacy DirectX SDK. For details, see [Where is the DirectX SDK?](https://aka.ms/dxsdk).

## Release Notes

FOR SECURITY ADVISORIES, see [GitHub](https://github.com/microsoft/UVAtlas/security/advisories).

For a full change history, see [CHANGELOG.md](https://github.com/microsoft/UVAtlas/blob/main/CHANGELOG.md).

* Starting with the December 2020 release, this library makes use of typed enum bitmask flags per the recommendation of the _C++ Standard_ section *17.5.2.1.3 Bitmask types*. This is consistent with Direct3D 12's use of the ``DEFINE_ENUM_FLAG_OPERATORS`` macro. This may have *breaking change* impacts to client code:

  * You cannot pass the ``0`` literal as your option flags value. Instead you must make use of the appropriate default enum value: ``UVATLAS_DEFAULT`` or ``UVATLAS_IMT_DEFAULT``.

  * Use the enum type instead of ``DWORD`` if building up flags values locally with bitmask operations. For example, ``UVATLAS options = UVATLAS_DEFAULT; if (...) options |= UVATLAS_GEODESIC_FAST;``

* The UWP projects and the Win10 classic desktop project include configurations for the ARM64 platform. Building these requires installing the ARM64 toolset.

* When using clang/LLVM for the ARM64 platform, the Windows 11 SDK ([22000](https://walbourn.github.io/windows-sdk-for-windows-11/)) or later is required.
